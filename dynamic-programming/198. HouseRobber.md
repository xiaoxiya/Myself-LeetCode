You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. 
Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint 
stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security 
system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent
houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, 
determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
Example 2:

Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
             
```java
class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        //dp[i] 为抢劫到第i家时，所拥有的最大金币，则不可能去抢第 i-1 家
        //dp[i] = max(dp[i-1] ,(nums[i] + dp[i-2]) )
        //pre1 记录dp[i-1], pre2记录nums[i] + dp[i-2]
        int pre1 = 0 ,pre2 = 0;
        int len = nums.length;
        for(int i =0 ;i<len ;i++) {
           int cur = max(pre2+nums[i] ,pre1);
           pre2 = pre1;
           pre1 = cur;
        }
       return pre1;
    }
    public int max (int i, int j) {
        if (i > j) return i;
        return j;
    }
}
```
